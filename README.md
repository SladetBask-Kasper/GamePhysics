# GamePhysics

This is kinda like a pre-alpha of a 2d game engine i might make, I have plans of adding openGL graphical capabilities to the "Engine" if you can even call it that. Maybe its more like a framework of something

# Goals

* The Current focus is to take this old project that I created years ago and redo alot of the code since I have learned alot since i started this project

* Adding more usefull tools to the engine/framework like function to automate alot of the stuff that you might wanna do etc...

* adding graphical capabilities to the engine/framework

* Suggenstions?...
